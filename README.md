# Simple TCP Server-Client interface in C

## Description

A simple Interface(server-client program) built in c using the Winsock library that allows multiple clients to communicate through the server.

- The little project was built as a practise task while completing the "CCNAv7: Introduction to Networks" Cisco course.
- The main goal of the project was to get a better understanding of how sockets and client/server interaction works at a basic level.
- Developing the project taught me how to implement a server and a client with simple functionality.
